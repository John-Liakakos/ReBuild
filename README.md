## Objective


ReBuildPlan is an executive-focused case study that proposes and quantifies a 3-year roster strategy for a target team. It combines roster diagnostics, prospect pipeline analysis, cap simulation, and prioritized transactions into a concise plan for ownership or an interim GM to execute.


## What this answers
- What are realistic short-term and long-term paths for the club?
- Which trades/free agent targets align with the timeline and cap constraints?
- What KPIs should be tracked to evaluate progress over each year?


## Key outputs
- `reports/3yr_rebuild_case_study.pdf` — 6–8 page detailed plan.
- `reports/exec_summary.pdf` — one-page summary for ownership.
- `models/` — linked spreadsheets for roster and cap assumptions (may reference CapSim).


## Methods & approach
- Diagnostic: age distribution, positional depth, contract risk.
- Scenario analysis: three strategic paths (Win-now, Balanced, Rebuild).
- Action list: prioritized trades, signings, and development moves with estimated costs/benefits.


## Quickstart


1. Edit `models/roster.csv` with the target team’s players and contract details.
2. Run `scripts/generate_report.py` to produce the PDF report (if implemented).
3. Review `reports/exec_summary.pdf` for a one-page view to present to stakeholders.
